 Campus Bridge â€“ Integrated Academic LMS + Coding Skill Development Platform

## Overview

**Campus Bridge** is a unified web application designed to provide an end-to-end academic and coding skill development environment for university students. Integrating Learning Management System (LMS) capabilities with coding training modules, the platform aims to bridge the gap between academic excellence and industry readiness. It also integrates AI-powered tools to enhance learning, collaboration, and job readiness.
